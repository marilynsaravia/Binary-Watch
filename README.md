## Description
This application is a Binary Clock built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It translates the current time into binary format (Base-2), displaying hours and minutes through a grid of LEDs.

It’s designed for those who appreciate the logic behind computing or just want a unique piece of "tech-decor" for their browser.

Current Features:

- Real-time update: The clock syncs with your system time every second.

- Binary Visualization: Separate rows for Hours (8-4-2-1) and Minutes (32-16-8-4-2-1).

- Digital Backup: Includes a standard digital display and PM indicator for quick reading.

- Responsive Design: Clean and adaptive interface that looks great on any screen.
